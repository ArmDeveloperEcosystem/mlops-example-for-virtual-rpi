### Building MLOps Pipelines with GitHub Actions on Virtual Raspberry Pi 4  

The virtual Raspberry Pi 4 provided by Arm, virtualize the functional behavior of SoCs and development kits,
including peripherals, sensors, and other board components. 
Virtual Raspberry Pi utilizes cloud-based servers and enable modern agile software development practices,
such as continuous integration and continuous deployment CI/CD (DevOps) and MLOps workflows to software developers. 

This technology avoids the complexity and cost of maintaining physical hardware installations and provides a natural and easy to use API for todayâ€™s software developers.


Step 1 - Integrate Arm NN Delegate to TFLite Interpreter

Step 1 - Create a Flask ML web server 

Step 2 - Create a docker file

Step 3- Create the requirements file

Step 4- Create a workflow that build a docker image and test the container using unittest

Step 5- Deploy the docker image on virtual raspberry pi 4
