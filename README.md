### Building MLOps Pipelines with GitHub Actions on Virtual Raspberry Pi 4  

The virtual Raspberry Pi 4 provided by Arm, virtualize the functional behavior of SoCs and development kits,
including peripherals, sensors, and other board components. 
Virtual Raspberry Pi utilizes cloud-based servers and enable modern agile software development practices,
such as continuous integration and continuous deployment CI/CD (DevOps) and MLOps workflows to software developers. 

This technology avoids the complexity and cost of maintaining physical hardware installations and provides a natural and easy to use API for todayâ€™s software developers.
